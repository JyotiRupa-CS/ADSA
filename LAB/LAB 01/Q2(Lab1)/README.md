## üìò Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of **Binary Search** and **Ternary Search** algorithms in C.  
It allows the user to input a sorted array, search for an element, and compare how many comparisons each algorithm performs to locate that element.

This helps visualize the performance differences between **Binary Search** (dividing array into 2 parts) and **Ternary Search** (dividing into 3 parts).

## üß† Features
- Accepts array size and elements from the user  
- Performs both **Binary Search** and **Ternary Search**  
- Displays:
  - Whether the element was found  
  - Index position (if found)  
  - Number of comparisons for each algorithm  
- Helps analyze the relative efficiency of both algorithms

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation

To compile using **GCC**, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
Q2(Lab1).exe
