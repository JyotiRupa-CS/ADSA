## 📘 Overview
This project implements a **Defective Coin Detection** algorithm in the C programming language.  
Given a set of coins where all coins have the same weight **except one defective coin**, the program identifies the **index** and **weight** of the defective coin.

The logic is based on comparing the weights of groups of coins to find the one that differs — similar to how we might use a **balance scale** in real life.

## 🧠 Features
- Accepts the number of coins and their respective weights as input.  
- Detects the defective (lighter or heavier) coin.  
- Displays:
  - The **index** of the defective coin.  
  - The **weight** of the defective coin.  
- Simple and efficient implementation using **comparison-based logic**.

## ⚙️ Compilation

To compile the program using **GCC**, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
Q3(Lab1).exe
