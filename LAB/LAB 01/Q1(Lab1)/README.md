# üìä Function Growth Comparison in C

This project demonstrates how different mathematical functions grow with respect to an input value **n**.  
It compares a set of commonly used time complexity functions such as **constant**, **logarithmic**, **linear**, **quadratic**, and **cubic** functions ‚Äî all implemented and analyzed using **C programming**.

---

## üéØ Objective

To evaluate and compare the growth rate of various mathematical functions by computing their values for a given input **n**, and then sorting them in increasing order.  
This experiment helps in understanding the **asymptotic growth behavior** of different algorithms.

## üß† Key Concepts Used

- **Function Pointers** in C  
  Used to dynamically store and call multiple mathematical functions.  

- **Structures (`struct`)**  
  Used to pair function names with their computed results.  

- **Sorting with `qsort()`**  
  Utilized to arrange the functions in ascending order based on their output values.  

- **Mathematical Operations (`math.h`)**  
  Includes operations like logarithm, power, and square root to compute function values.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Accepts user input for the value of **n**  
- Computes values of **12 different mathematical functions**  
- Sorts them based on growth rate  
- Displays the functions in increasing order of their values  
- Demonstrates practical use of **function pointers**, **structs**, and **standard library sorting**
