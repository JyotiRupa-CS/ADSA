# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) in C

## üìò Overview
This program finds the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** and **all common subsequences** between two input strings using **Dynamic Programming** and **recursion** techniques.

The **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** problem is a classic computer science problem that aims to determine the longest sequence that appears in the same relative order (but not necessarily contiguous) in both strings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Computes the **length of the LCS**.
- Displays **one LCS** using backtracking.
- Generates **all possible common subsequences**.
- User-friendly implementation with clear logic flow.
- Uses **Dynamic Programming** for efficient computation.

## üß† Algorithm Used
1. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction**
   - Builds a 2D table where `dp[i][j]` represents the LCS length of prefixes `X[0..i-1]` and `Y[0..j-1]`.
2. **Backtracking**
   - Reconstructs one LCS from the filled DP table.
3. **Recursion**
   - Enumerates all possible common subsequences by exploring all matching character positions recursively.
