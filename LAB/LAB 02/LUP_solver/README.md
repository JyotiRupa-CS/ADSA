# LU Decomposition in C

This repository contains a **C program** that performs **LU Decomposition (without pivoting)** of a square matrix and solves a system of linear equations of the form:

\[
Ax = b
\]

It decomposes the input matrix `A` into **Lower (L)** and **Upper (U)** triangular matrices, then solves for the unknown vector `x` using **forward** and **backward substitution**.

## üß† Overview

**LU Decomposition** is a method used to solve systems of linear equations, invert matrices, or compute determinants efficiently.  

It expresses a matrix `A` as:

\[
A = LU
\]

Where:  
- `L` ‚Üí Lower triangular matrix with 1s on the diagonal  
- `U` ‚Üí Upper triangular matrix  

Once the matrix is decomposed, the system `Ax = b` becomes:

\[
LUx = b
\]

Letting `Ux = y`, we first solve **Ly = b** (forward substitution), and then **Ux = y** (backward substitution).

## üß© Features

‚úÖ Takes any **n √ó n** square matrix and a vector `b` as input.  
‚úÖ Performs **LU decomposition** without pivoting.  
‚úÖ Solves for the vector **x** using forward and backward substitution.  
‚úÖ Displays **L**, **U**, and **x** clearly.  
‚úÖ Handles **zero pivot detection** with proper error messages.

## üìò Example Representation

Given:

\[
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 & 1 \\
4 & 7 & 7 \\
-2 & 4 & 5
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
b =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
2 \\
3
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The program will find `L`, `U`, and the solution vector `x` such that:

\[
A = LU \quad \text{and} \quad Ax = b
\]
